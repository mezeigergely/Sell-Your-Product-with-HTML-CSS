    <h3>Super Shell Technology</h3>
    <p>The Pearl Export EXX 5-piece drum kit's poplar and Asian mahogany shells are constructed using Pearl's proprietary Superior Shell Technology. This construction method incorporates Pearl's trademarked AcoustiGlue that is boiled into the shells and pressed at over 1,000 lbs. of hydraulic pressure, making the shell act and resonate as a single ply. SST uses precision-cut scarf joints to join the seams of the shells, offering over 800% more contact area than standard butt joints. This technology makes these drums so durable that they come with a limited lifetime warranty from Pearl. And to make these shells sound even better, Pearl outfits them with new lugs that minimize shell interaction for maximum resonance and sustain.</p>
    <h3>Opti-Loc mounting is stable and enhances your tone</h3>
    <p>Pearl Export EXX series Opti-Loc mounting system features a triangular design with two tension rod attachment points that hold your toms firmly in place with no wobble. Pearl places rubber isolators at all of the connection points to allow the shells to vibrate freely for more sustain and resonance. The Opti-Loc mounting system keeps your toms right where you need them and sounding their best, whether you're practicing at home or recording drum tracks at a studio.</p>
